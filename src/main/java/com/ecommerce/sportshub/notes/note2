Product & order Service
----

ProductService.java
method to create a product, update a product, delete a product, get a product by Id, get all products, get product by category,
search product.


ProductServiceImpl.java
It implements ProductService interface which contain all methods. and we are using that methods in implementation.



Now write service to create and manage orders

OrderItemService.java
method to place order, update order item status, filter order items,


OrderItemServiceImpl.java
implements OrderItemService interface it contains methods and that methods we are going to be using in impl.

inject orderRepo, orderItemRepo, productRepo, userService, entityDtoMapper.

Note:
User can make an order with one item or with multiple items.
An Order contains an order items and an amount. go to OrderRequest dto.

so to place an order we are going to first of all go over the order request, loop over all the order items and get the
products from the productId, package it together and make and save the data on our backend.

So before we do that, let me just make sure that a user is the one placing an order.
go to Order entity .
getting the actual product that the user is ordering.

the total price is coming from order request.
