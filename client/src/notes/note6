I had made some changes to make website Responsive.



Responsive Website:
---

Making NavBar and Footer responsive by applying css and media queries.
Making ProductList Responsive means Add To cart is removed and description is also responsive.
Making Product Details Responsive for all devices.
And at last making pagination responsive like if more pagination buttons so hide it and show ...



I Had made some changes in Navbar.css like applying navy blue light color. and also applied light orange color to all components of dark orange color.


I had apply media queries to all css ... To amke responsive for android also
