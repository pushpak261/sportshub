npm install @paypal/react-paypal-js


I have modified Cart Page and Address Page.

And integrate Paypal in cart page

and OrderConfirmationPage also..'

PayPalButton.jsx
OrderConfirmationPage.jsx



Go to the PayPal Developer website.
Once logged in, navigate to Dashboard and create a new REST API app under the My Apps & Credentials section. This will provide you with a Client ID.
You can also use by default ClientId and secret key.

https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox

Apps And Credentials.

and use this client Id and secret key in PayPalButton.jsx.


Configure in App.js

MapComponent.jsx
---
I had also used Map Component in Address Page to get the City Location. where I had used OpenCage API Key...
and use this component directly in AddressPage.jsx.
It track location based on city and zipcode.

I had also made changes in AddressPage so that MapComponent matches with AddressPage. And also I had made change
in App.js so when whe Add or edit Address than NavBar Component will be hidden.
